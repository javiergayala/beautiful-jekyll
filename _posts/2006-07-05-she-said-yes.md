**I&#8217;m getting married!**

On July 1, 2006 I proposed to Laura Lennox at the [Tower of the Americas](http://www.toweroftheamericas.com) here in San Antonio, Texas. It was a beautiful, clear night. It went off without a hitch despite Laura&#8217;s intense fear of heights.

Stay tuned for more info about the wedding! As of right now, we are leaning towards April, 2007. We are planning on creating a wedding website, and when we do I&#8217;ll post the link.

Javier
