    Well, we made it home without much excitement. Chris's corp won 2nd place in the finals. He was on cloud nine, and he deserved it! He and the others in his corps worked really hard. We saw them practicing in the triple-digit heat here in south Texas back in July.

    We only got to visit with him for a few hours after the competition. We had to leave for Chicago at 7AM on Sunday to make our flight home. I wish we could've spent more time with him. We won't see him again until Christmas.

Well, we made it home without much excitement. Chris&#8217;s corp won 2nd place in the finals. He was on cloud nine, and he deserved it! He and the others in his corps worked really hard. We saw them practicing in the triple-digit heat here in south Texas back in July.

We only got to visit with him for a few hours after the competition. We had to leave for Chicago at 7AM on Sunday to make our flight home. I wish we could&#8217;ve spent more time with him. We won&#8217;t see him again until Christmas.

My Chris started school today. Day 1 of the 8th grade. He&#8217;s the big man on campus this year. I hope he enjoys it while he can. A year from now he&#8217;ll be a little fish in a MUCH bigger pond.
