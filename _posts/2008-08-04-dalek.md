Introducing the newest member of my family, Dalek the [Bearded Dragon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearded_dragon)! We aren&#8217;t sure if Dalek is a he or a she, and I&#8217;m really not sure what owning a bearded dragon will entail. Laura is the one who will be keeping track of it, but I think it&#8217;s cool nonetheless. They are supposed to be able to grow to 24&#8243; long, and Andi is excited about being able to &#8220;walk it&#8221;. ðŸ™‚
