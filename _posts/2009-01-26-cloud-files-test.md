A few months back the company that I work for, [Rackspace Hosting](https://www.rackspace.com/), began offering a product called [&#8220;Cloud Files&#8221;](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files) through one of our subsidiaries, Rackspace Cloud.  It&#8217;s a [CDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Delivery_Network) method for distributing files via the Internet.  You upload your files to the &#8220;Cloud Files Container&#8221; (I&#8217;m using [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/)), and it gets propagated into <a title="Limelight Network" href="http://www.limelightnetworks.com/" target="_blank">Limelight Network&#8217;s</a> CDN.

A lot of my customers are asking questions about using Cloud Files, so I figured I&#8217;d give it a try and see how it works!  A few minutes ago, I uploaded my very first file to the Cloud.  It&#8217;s a 1.1MB high-resolution satellite image of Washington D.C. taken during President Obama&#8217;s inauguration.
