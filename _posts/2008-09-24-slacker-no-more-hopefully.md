    I haven't updated my Blog in a while. Bad blogger! My reasoning is just lack of time. I've now done something to remove that excuse.

    I've installed a module that allows me to post updates via email. This means that if I'm stuck at a doctor's office or anywhere else, I can type up an update on my new BlackBerry Pearl and submit it via email. Hopefully it helps!
