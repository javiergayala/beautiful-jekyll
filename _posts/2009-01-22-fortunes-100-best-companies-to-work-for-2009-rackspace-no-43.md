Check out the following article:

[Fortune Magazine List of 100 Best Companies to Work For 2009](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2009/snapshots/1.html)

The company that I work for, [Rackspace Hosting](https://www.rackspace.com/), made the [Fortune Magazine](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/) list of the 100 best companies to work for in the country for 2009!  Number 43 to be exact.  The only other company headquartered in San Antonio, TX to make the list was [Valero Energy](http://www.valero.com/) at number 93.
