    We are now in Madison, WI at Camp Randall Stadium. The temperature is a cool and breezy 70 degrees.  It feels awesome!

    We spent the majority of the day in Chicago. We went to the skydeck of the Sears Tower and saw the awesome view, then had some delicious stuffed pizza. After our 2PM lunch, I paid $26 to leave the parking garage after 3 hours! Oh yeah! And we saw a poor old lady fall and bust her head open in a souvenier shop. Her daughters were already talking lawsuit!

    Well, its time for me to get back to the competition. Chris's corps is almost on!
