Every morning, I take the same route to work.  It never fails that at least once a week (though often more then once) there is an accident on I-410 West-bound on the bridge over Bandera Rd.  What is it about this location that causes so many accidents?  I don&#8217;t get it!  It&#8217;s ALWAYS in the same spot!  It jams traffic up for miles.  You would think that with the thousands of cars that pass by those accidents each week that the people who frequent that route would learn.  I wish I knew what it was about this particular spot that caused people to ram into each other.  Here is the spot in case you would like to avoid it:
