  Belle is the best dog I&#8217;ve ever had. She is very gentle. She&#8217;s the only dog I have ever had that didn&#8217;t nearly bite my hand off when I handed her food or treats. She only barks when there is a stranger outside. She listens to your commands, and she is potty trained. All without ANY formal training.

  She is kind of weird though. This is a picture of depicting how she normally relaxes. She LOVES to lay down like this. She&#8217;s a strange one&#8230;.
