I did something new yesterday.  I did some Rails. [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) to be exact.  It&#8217;s pretty darn neat! If you haven&#8217;t heard of it before, it&#8217;s a web framework that lets you easily create and maintain database-driven websites.  You can setup a simple site in a matter of minutes!

I also played with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) itself today.  It&#8217;s the scripting language that Rails runs on.  I was able to do something with it that I have never been able to do with any other programming language&#8230;at least not this easily.  I wrote a script that can SSH into a server and issue a list of commands.  It will make my life MUCHO easier!  

Daniel has been trying to get me to try [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) for a long time now, but I&#8217;ve been resistent.  It wasn&#8217;t until [Apple](http://www.apple.com) wrote an [article](http://developer.apple.com/tools/rubyonrails.html) on it that I really took notice.  Hooray Apple!  Now if they would only drop the prices of their Intel products&#8230;..
