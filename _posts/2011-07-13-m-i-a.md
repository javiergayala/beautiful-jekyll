I know. I know. Where have I been? It&#8217;s been like a year since my last post. Well, the last year has been quite&#8230;.how shall I put it&#8230;.busy. In the past year, I have marked my 11th anniversary at [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/), and I graduated with an Associate&#8217;s Degree from San Antonio College. The biggest change is that Laura is currently 36 weeks pregnant with a baby boy whom we will be naming Rylan Elias Ayala! He is expected anytime between this very moment, and Tuesday July 19th.

I hope to post more developments of Rylan&#8217;s birth and first few days here on this blog. Stay posted!

Javier
