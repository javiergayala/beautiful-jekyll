I have always loved History. It was my favorite subject growing up. If I ever had access to a time machine, I think I&#8217;d probably spend more time investigating the past then the future.

One thing that I really love to see are &#8220;Then & Now&#8221; pictures of places. I have a book called [San Antonio, Then and Now](http://www.amazon.com/San-Antonio-Then-Now/dp/1592234070/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1216831319&sr=8-1) that shows pictures taken from the same vantage point from various places around the city. It shows the picture of the location from the past, along with a more recent picture.

While voyaging through the Internet today, I stumbled upon a &#8220;Then & Now&#8221; image of [Paghman Gardens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paghman_Gardens) in Afghanistan. The images are from 1967 and 2007. It documents just how much change can happen from 40 years of war. You can see the images for yourself at:

Pretty sad.
