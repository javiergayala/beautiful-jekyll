Hello!

I&#8217;ve updated this site to [Drupal](http://drupal.org) 6.2. As a result, a lot of stuff is broken. I&#8217;m working on it, but it may take some time to get everything fixed.

## *\*\*UPDATE\*\**

### July 3, 2008

I think I&#8217;ve fixed the parts of the site that were broken! Turns out that Drupal now requires you to use a &#8220;drupal\_add\_js()&#8221; function to add javascript inline to the page. I also had to update some of the changes to the Forms API for the SMTPAuth Encoder. (**UPDATE: Currently Offline)

If anyone uses anything on this site and you find it broken, please let me know!
