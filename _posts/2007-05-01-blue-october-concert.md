    Laura and I went to Mixfest at Sunset Station on Friday 4/27/07 where we got to see Blue October!  The concert was AWESOME!  By far the BEST concert I have ever attended.  We started out about 50 feet from the stage, and by the end of the concert, Laura had pushed our way to about 10 feet from the stage.

If you haven&#8217;t heard Blue October, I highly recommend them. They are one of those bands that sounds better live and in person then they do on the CD, although that&#8217;s not to say that they don&#8217;t sound good on the CD, because they do. They put so much heart and emotion in their performance that you can&#8217;t help but feel what they feel along with them.

I took some pictures with my camera phone. The pics can be found in my [picture gallery](http://pics.landofthegargoyle.com/index.php/Misc/BlueOctober_4-07).
