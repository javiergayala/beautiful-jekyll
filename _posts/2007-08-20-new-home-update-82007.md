    <p>Well, I got an email from our customer service rep at Pulte on Friday.  He said that the &quot;final&quot; date on our house is December 3rd.  That is the date that they say everything should be complete, and we would close on it a couple of days later.  I'm still a bit skeptical since they haven't even broken ground on it.  I guess we'll see!  Wish us luck!</p>
