Well, it&#8217;s that time of the year again! The [DCI](http://www.dci.org)
Southwestern Championship is in San Antonio this Saturday, July 19th! This
year, I&#8217;ll be cheering on [The Cavaliers](http://www.cavaliers.org/).

This year is my brother-in-law&#8217;s age-out year, and he chose [The
Cavaliers](http://www.cavaliers.org/) as the corps that he wanted to be in for
his last year. Last year he was in the World Champion
[Blue Devils](http://www.bluedevils.org), the year before that he was a member
of the 1st place drum line for [Phantom Regiment](http://www.regiment.org/),
before that he was a member of [The Crossmen](http://www.crossmen.org), and
finally before that he started out with
[The Jersey Surf](http://www.jerseysurf.org).

I went to watch them practice last night, and MAN were they AMAZING! Their show this year is called &#8220;Samurai&#8221;, and I can not wait to see them perform it at the Alamodome tomorrow night! These guys are dedicated! It was H-O-T yesterday in the hot summer Texas sun, and they never slowed down! I was highly impressed, and I wish them all the best of luck on Saturday, and for the rest of the season!
