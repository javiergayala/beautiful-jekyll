  <p>I've recently begun playing with <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>.  It's a Content Management System written in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>.  So far, I've moved my blog over, and I'm trying to get my photo gallery integrated into it.  So far, it's been pretty easy to use, and I'm pretty impressed!  Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

I&#8217;ve recently begun playing with [Drupal](http://drupal.org). It&#8217;s a Content Management System written in [PHP](http://www.php.net). So far, I&#8217;ve moved my blog over, and I&#8217;m trying to get my photo gallery integrated into it. So far, it&#8217;s been pretty easy to use, and I&#8217;m pretty impressed! Stay tuned for more updates!
