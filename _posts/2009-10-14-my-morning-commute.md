I decided that my first &#8220;project&#8221; to use my Flip UltraHD camera on would be a time-lapse video of my morning drive. I shot the video the morning of October 13, 2009. This morning was a bit atypical since it was raining, which has been rare this year in San Antonio. The rain led to a somewhat longer commute then usual (60 min. vs. the usual 40 min.)

I took the footage from the Flip and imported it into [iMovie](http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/) on my MacBook Pro. From there, I sped up the video by 800%. The resulting video was 9 minutes long as opposed to the original 60 minutes. I think that if I do this again, I may speed it up 1600% instead. Anyway&#8230;.you can find it below.
