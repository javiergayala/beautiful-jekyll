So, I was in New York City on Thursday and Friday of last week (2/26-2/27). I went to the Omni Berkshire on 52nd street to meet up with some co-workers, and there I saw NYC&#8217;s BIGGEST sewer rat EVER!

I&#8217;m not sure what they were protesting. Something about construction at The Pratt Institute. It was pretty cool! I wanted to join in on the fun!
