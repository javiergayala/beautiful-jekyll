![Contemporary Resort Lighting Prototype]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/20121213-211452.jpg)


This is my wiring prototype for an idea that I had to improve the Contemporary Resort that is part of my Disney Monorail set. I put it up around my Christmas tree every year, but it seemed like it needed a little something to make it &#8220;POP&#8221;! I&#8217;m hoping that by adding some accent lighting to it, it might help it look a little more realistic.

If this goes well, I have some ideas on how I can add some lighting accents to the Polynesian Resort on the other side of my Christmas tree.

**_Details:_**

  * 12 White LEDs (6 parallel strands consisting of 2 LEDs each)
  * Power Source: 9v Battery
