### Update: 9/11/07

My hopes and dreams have been dashed. My submission to [Threadless](http://www.threadless.com) was declined. I guess I wasn&#8217;t cut-out to be an artist.

I still like the design, so I&#8217;ve gone ahead and setup an online store with [Cafepress](http://www.cafepress.com) to offer the shirt for sale. You can reach it at:

[Land of The Gargoyle &#8211; Online Store](http://www.cafepress.com/gargoyleland)

#### End Update

I designed a shirt to declare my love for triplets! It&#8217;s called &#8220;I &hearts; Triplets!&#8221;  I posted it on the [Threadless](http://www.threadless.com/) website.  It hasn&#8217;t been approved yet, but once it has been, please feel free to vote for it!
