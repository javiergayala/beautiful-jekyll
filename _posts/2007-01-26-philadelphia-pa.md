I got back from a trip to Philly on Tuesday. Â Laura and I went up there for a bridal shower that her family threw for her. Â We had a great time! Â I got to play in some snow with Laura&#8217;s cousin Sam! Â It was the first time in 22 years that I&#8217;ve seen snow.

Here is a shot of my feet to prove that I was in the snow!

While we were there, we went to the King of Prussia Mall. Â It was HUGE! Â There was one thing that caught my eye, however. Â While walking through Macy&#8217;s looking for some gloves, I spotted an iPod vending machine in the men&#8217;s department!

All in all, we had fun. Â Even got to have an authentic Cheesesteak from [Geno&#8217;s Steaks](http://www.genossteaks.com). Â It blew away every single other Cheesesteak I have ever had. Â Hands down.While I was there, I was also introduced to [Wawa](http://www.wawa.com/WawaWeb/), a regional convenience store. Â It was AWESOME! Â They had some outstanding hot dogs, and I would venture to say that I liked their coffee better then Starbuck&#8217;s.Well, that&#8217;s it from me for now! We are now less then two months from the wedding! Â Things are starting to pick up! Â ðŸ™‚
