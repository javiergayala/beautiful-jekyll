An online city guide website [Schmap](http://www.schmap.com/) has used one of my pictures in the 2009 edition of their [Vienna, Austria city guide](http://www.schmap.com/vienna/home/).  They found a picture that I took of the [Hotel Sacher](https://www.sacher.com/en/) in my [Flickr gallery](https://www.flickr.com/photos/landofthegargoyle/albums).  The picture was taken during my recent trip to Vienna and the Czech Republic.

Here is the actual image:
