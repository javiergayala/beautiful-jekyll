    I found a link where someone created a <a href="http://mamedev.org/">MAME</a> console that looks like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS">TARDIS</a> from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/">Doctor Who</a>!  It looks AWESOME!  In case you don't know what <a href="http://mamedev.org/">MAME</a> is, it's and emulator that emulates the hardware in the old cabinet arcade machines and let's you run the ROMs for those old games.  You can find more info <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAME">here</a>.  The link to the TARDIS version is:
