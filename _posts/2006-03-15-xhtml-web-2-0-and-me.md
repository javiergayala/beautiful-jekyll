    Well, it looks like I've successfully converted <a href="http://landofthegargoyle.com">my website</a> to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML 1.0</a>!  It was
    kind of a pain in the butt, but I think it was worth it in the long run.  I was able to clean up a bunch of mess left behind by my lazyness when coding the site initially.  Supposedly, XHTML is supposed to be more "extensible" (which is where the X in XHTML comes from), but I guess we'll see.  It's supposed to be a big part of what makes the newer "Web 2.0" sites.

Well, it looks like I&#8217;ve successfully converted [my website](http://www.javierayala.com) to [XHTML 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/)! It was kind of a pain in the butt, but I think it was worth it in the long run. I was able to clean up a bunch of mess left behind by my lazyness when coding the site initially. Supposedly, XHTML is supposed to be more &#8220;extensible&#8221; (which is where the X in XHTML comes from), but I guess we&#8217;ll see. It&#8217;s supposed to be a big part of what makes the newer &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; sites.

I kind of like the look of the newer Web 2.0 sites. I found an article on Web 2.0 site design, and I think I&#8217;m going to try and convert my website to have more of that type of look and feel. I&#8217;m already using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which will help, and I&#8217;ve added my first bit of DHTML (Dynamic HTML) code to the site. If you&#8217;re wondering what I&#8217;ve added, it&#8217;s the menu on the left hand side. Notice how when you mouse over it the button grows darker, then lighter when you mouse away from it? That&#8217;s all DHTML. I must say, it is a lot cleaner then my old menu.
