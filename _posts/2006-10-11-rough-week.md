  It's been a rough couple of days.  On Monday I got to work to find that the hard drive in my server had died.  I had to re-install and restore what I could.  The only
  thing that is still not available is my photo gallery.  I completely lost the database that was used for that application.  I have to re-create the entire thing.  I'm so bummed.



  Anyway....things are starting to look up, I guess.  It's Wednesday....my server is back on line and I took the opportunity to upgrade to the latest OS....I guess things will be OK.
   :-)
