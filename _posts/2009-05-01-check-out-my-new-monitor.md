As a reward for some work that I did with my job, I was given a brand new 24&#8243; Dell 2408WFP UltraSharp monitor.  It is now running as my main display off of my MacBook Pro.  I also have a 19&#8243; Dell E196FP monitor connected to the MacBook Pro over USB via an <a title="IOGear GUC2015V" href="http://www.iogear.com/product/GUC2015V/" target="_blank">IOGear GUC2015V External Video Card</a>.  That&#8217;s right, count them&#8230;THREE displays running off of one MacBook Pro!  Jealous?

Want to know more about it?  Click <a title="My new monitor setup" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/landofthegargoyle/3490722375" target="_blank">here</a> to be taken to the Flickr website where you can see the notes that I attached to the picture.
