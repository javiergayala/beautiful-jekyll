So, last week I rented a Fetal Doppler Heartbeat Monitor so that Laura and I could hear the heartbeats coming from the twins. Â It was delivered yesterday, and we gave it a try. Â Here are two MP3s that I made of the heartbeats. Â In the second one, you can hear Andi saying that she thinks it sounds like a dog. Â I think she was referring to the sound of a dog panting.
