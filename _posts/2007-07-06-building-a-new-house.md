    <p>Well, it's official!  Laura and I got final approval on a loan for a new house yesterday!  We are going to be building a new <a href="http://www.pulte.com">Pulte</a> home in the new Alamo Ranch area off of SH-151 and Loop 1604.  It's a one-floor, 4 bedroom, 2.5 bath house with a brick exterior.  It's gonna be awesome!  We are going to go to the home center this afternoon to finalize all of our selections for the tile, carpet, brick and countertops.  Stay posted for more details!</p>
