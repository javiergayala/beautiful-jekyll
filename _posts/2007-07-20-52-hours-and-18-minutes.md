    So....on Tuesday I bought a program called <a href="http://www.micromat.com/">Tech Tool Pro</a>.&nbsp; I had seen some errors in my laptop's system logs that indicated that my drive was highly fragmented.&nbsp; I had always thought this to not be possible on an HFS+ filesystem.&nbsp; I was incorrect.&nbsp; Apparently, this can happen if you have less then 10% of your drive space free.&nbsp; I did have less then 10% free.

So&#8230;.on Tuesday I bought a program called [Tech Tool Pro](http://www.micromat.com/).&nbsp; I had seen some errors in my laptop&#8217;s system logs that indicated that my drive was highly fragmented.&nbsp; I had always thought this to not be possible on an HFS+ filesystem.&nbsp; I was incorrect.&nbsp; Apparently, this can happen if you have less then 10% of your drive space free.&nbsp; I did have less then 10% free.

At 1:02PM on Tuesday, July 17th, I began the defrag process.&nbsp; 52 hours and 18 minutes later, it was complete.&nbsp; Moral of the story.&nbsp; If you have an HFS+ filesystem, always keep at least 10% of your drive free.
