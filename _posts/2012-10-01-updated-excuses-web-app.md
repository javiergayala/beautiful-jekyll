I have updated the [Excuse Generator!](http://www.javierayala.com/excuses/ "Excuse Generator") I used it as a basis for toying around with creating my own API that would return JSON responses. The new Web App is iOS compatible on the iPhone and iPad, and uses AJAX to refresh the excuses. It is built with Bootstrap and JQuery. A special feature is that it will generate excuses for church on Sundays!* Give it a try!
