This morning while I was walking the dogs, I found some keys that someone had left behind at the mailbox cluster.  I asked my mom to take them to the leasing office and turn them in once they opened for the day and was going to ask my newly-turned 5-year-old son, Rylan, to help her.  I figured it would be an "adventure" for him.  I was wrong...

> **Me:** Ry! I need help from a 5 year old and an old lady! Do you know a five year old and an old lady that can help me?  
> **Ry _(looking up from his game)_:** Jacob and Memo. (Goes back to his game)  
> **Me:** Hmmm... I don't know where Jacob is. Are there any OTHER five year olds that can help me?  
> **Ry _(Without looking up from his game)_:** Madeleine. Or one of my other friends from Castle Hills First Baptist.  
> **Me _(Leaning in)_:** What about you?! You are five!  
> **Ry _(Looking up from his game, Sighs & shakes his head then goes back to his game)_:** I'm not helping.  

Little stinker.....
