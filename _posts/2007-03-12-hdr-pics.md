  I've been playing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging" title="Wikipedia - HDR Imaging">HDR Photos</a> recently.  Ever since I first saw some examples, I've wanted to do it myself.  I uploaded some examples of my first attempt to my gallery at <a href="http://pics.landofthegargoyle.com/v/LandscapePhotos/Downtown_HDR_01/" title="Downtown HDR Pictures">http://pics.landofthegargoyle.com/v/LandscapePhotos/Downtown_HDR_01/.</a>  Check them out!
