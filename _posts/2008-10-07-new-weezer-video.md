    <a href="http://www.weezer.com/">Weezer</a> debuted a new video last night for their latest single, "Troublemaker".  Not quite as entertaining as the video for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muP9eH2p2PI">Pork &amp; Beans</a>, but still good.  I like how they are not afraid to have fun and make fun of themselves.

[Weezer](http://www.weezer.com/) debuted a new video last night for their latest single, &#8220;Troublemaker&#8221;. Not quite as entertaining as the video for [Pork & Beans](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQHPYelqr0E), but still good. I like how they are not afraid to have fun and make fun of themselves.



On a related note, I&#8217;ll be going to the [Weezer](http://www.weezer.com/) concert in Austin on October 20th! I&#8217;m excited! Not only will I get to see [Weezer](http://www.weezer.com/), but [Angels & Airwaves](http://www.angels-and-airwaves.com/){.broken_link} is opening up for them! In case you aren&#8217;t aware of who they are their lead singer is [Tom DeLonge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_DeLonge), former lead singer of [Blink 182](http://www.blink182.com/). Looks to be a great concert in all! Can&#8217;t wait!
