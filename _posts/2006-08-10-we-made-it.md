    Well, we got to the airport at 5AM to find out that the airports had been raised to threat level orange due to a terrorist plot uncovered in the UK. Luckily we had already packed all liquids in checked baggage. It took a little longer to get through security, but we made it ok.

    The flight to Chicago was pretty uneventful, other then getting re-routed 45 minutes out of the way due to inclement weather. The weather here is humid and VERY overcast. We can't see the tops of any of the buildings.

    BUT.....there was one ray of sunshine....
