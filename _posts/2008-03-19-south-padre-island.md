So&#8230;.a couple of months ago, I reserved a hotel room in South Padre Island for this week so that Laura and I could go and get away for our 1<sup>st</sup> wedding anniversary. Well, we have decided to take Andi with us. Everyone that we have told this to has said that we are crazy. They&#8217;ve said that South Padre is going to be too wild for her. I&#8217;ll be honest&#8230;I&#8217;m starting to get a little nervous. I guess I just figured that with all the miles of beaches on the island, we should be able to find SOME place that wasn&#8217;t too crazy.

I guess we&#8217;ll see how it goes. Hopefully Andi doesn&#8217;t show up in the background of some &#8220;Girls Gone Wild&#8221; video!
