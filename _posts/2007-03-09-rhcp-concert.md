I went to the [Red Hot Chili Peppers](http://www.redhotchilipeppers.com) concert on Tuesday night (3/6/07). It was awesome! The opening act was [Gnarls Barkley](http://www.gnarlsbarkley.com). Unfortunately, I missed most of their performance. I was stuck in line trying to buy some T-shirts.

The Chili Peppers were really, really, awesome. Kiedis sang well, but really didn&#8217;t interact with the crowd. The other guys (John Fusciante &#8211; guitar, Flea &#8211; Bass, Chad Smith &#8211; Drums) were unbelievably good! They are VERY accomplished musicians. The things that Flea can do with a bass are mind-boggling! He could have a concert on his own, playing by himself, and it would sell out!

Out of 5 stars, I would give this concert a 4.75. These guys are legends, and having the opportunity to listen to them with my own ears was an experience that I&#8217;ll remember forever. My only complaint was the lack of audience participation by the band. Aside from a few basketball-related remarks (such as Flea&#8217;s &#8220;Go Lakers!&#8221;), there was no interaction. Definitely worth it though!
