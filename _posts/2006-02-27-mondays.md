excerpt: |
  I hate Mondays.  I am not a Monday person.  I am always tired on Monday, no matter how much sleep I got the night before.  I've tried everything, from getting more sleep the night before, to getting less sleep the night before, to trying coffee.  Nothing helps.  Even my Adderall seems to work less on Mondays.  Why is that? Why can't Monday be like any other day of the week? Why can't someone invent a "Monday Pill" to fix everything? WHY?!
