I got a fortune cookie with my lunch today.  The fortune said:

<tt>When you're finished changing, you're finished.</tt>

At first, I was a bit disappointed in this fortune.  I felt as though I had been cheated.  I mean, duh!  When you&#8217;re finished changing, of course you&#8217;re finished!  You just said you&#8217;re finished changing!

Then I thought about it a little more.  I realized that it had more depth then I had given it.  When you as a person are no longer changing, you ARE finished.  Finito. Done.  If you aren&#8217;t changing, then you aren&#8217;t growing or evolving as a person.  The only people who stop changing are dead people.  So in a sense, when you finish changing, you really are finished.
