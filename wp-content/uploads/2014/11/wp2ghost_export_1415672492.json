He was my grandfather, Jimmy Martinez, or \"Grampy\" as we knew him. My Grampy was quite a man.\u00c2\u00a0 He was born on a farm in Lytle, TX and was one of nine siblings.\u00c2\u00a0 As an adult, he married my grandmother, Angela Martinez (formerly Sanchez).\u00c2\u00a0 He had two daughters.\u00c2\u00a0 His oldest was my aunt, Virginia Garcia; his youngest was my mother, Elizabeth Ann Ayala.\u00c2\u00a0 Each daughter had two children.\u00c2\u00a0 In order of age the grandchildren are Richard Garcia, myself, Leticia Cardenas, and my brother Miguel Ayala. Grampy was a veteran of World War II, where he was discharged after being medically disabled.\u00c2\u00a0 This led to his involvement as a member of San Antonio Chapter 25 of the [Disabled American Veterans](http:\/\/www.dav.org).\u00c2\u00a0 Upon discharge from the Army Air Corps, where he had been an aircraft mechanic, he entered civil service at [Fort Sam Houston](http:\/\/www.samhouston.army.mil\/) in San Antonio, TX.\u00c2\u00a0 He also maintained a part-time job working at [Penner's](http:\/\/www.pennersinc.com\/) in downtown San Antonio in order to ensure that his two daughters had the funding necessary to obtain college degrees. Always a hard working man, Grampy was very proud of his yard and his home for as long as anyone can remember.\u00c2\u00a0 Gardening was something that he truly enjoyed and he would maintain a variety of vegetation, with the most prominent being his beloved rose bushes.\u00c2\u00a0 Most important to him, however, was family. Grampy did all he could to make sure that his family was cared for and loved.\u00c2\u00a0 As a child, Grampy would take my cousins, my brother and I to the park every chance he had.\u00c2\u00a0 Anytime we had a day off from school, we would make a day of it.\u00c2\u00a0 Shortly after arriving at his house in the morning, Granny would begin packing a lunch for everyone.\u00c2\u00a0 Once lunch was ready, we would all pile into Grampy's car, and away we would go.\u00c2\u00a0 Each outing was an adventure.\u00c2\u00a0 Our destination was always a surprise.\u00c2\u00a0 Whenever we would ask where we were going, his answer was always the same, \"Passamaquoddy.\" Once we arrived at our destination, we would spend hours playing outside in the warmth of the sun.\u00c2\u00a0 He would sit quietly nearby and watch us play on the jungle gym, or sometimes he would even help us fly a kite.\u00c2\u00a0 When it was time to return home, he would tell us it was time to go.\u00c2\u00a0 Once again we'd ask him where our destination was, and his answer to that question as well was always the same, \"To the best place on Earth, 1454 West Malone.\" Grampy taught me a lot of things that have shaped me as a person, a father, and a human being.\u00c2\u00a0 He taught me at a young age that my father was not \"mean\" because he grounded me, but rather that he grounded me because of his love for me.\u00c2\u00a0 He taught me that hard work was not a bad thing, or a punishment, but rather a means to a heightened sense of satisfaction and pride once the work was complete.\u00c2\u00a0 He taught me that patience is your most important tool when dealing with someone less knowledgeable than you through his ability to never lose his patience with his grand kids while we were learning right from wrong.\u00c2\u00a0 He taught me to always treat others with respect, and to treat them how YOU would want to be treated, not necessarily how they deserved to be treated.\u00c2\u00a0 He taught me how to be giving, and instilled in me a desire to help people in any way that I can.\u00c2\u00a0 His most important lesson by far was that family matters.\u00c2\u00a0 Family is important. If you devote yourself to your family, your family will devote itself to you.\u00c2\u00a0 The standing-room-only crowd at his Rosary was a testament to that. I will miss my Grampy, but I will never forget him.\u00c2\u00a0 He is now, and will forever, be a part of me and who I am.\u00c2\u00a0 I, along with my cousins and our parents, are his legacy.\u00c2\u00a0 Through our actions in this world, my Grampy will continue to live.

Me","slug":"about-me","markdown":"\n### In the beginning....\n\n Javier Ayala was born to a couple of circus performers in 1975.\u00c2\u00a0 His father was either Giovanni or Bruce who were Siamese twins in the circus.\u00c2\u00a0 His mother was Hilda, the bearded lady. From age 2 Javier began learning the art of circus performing and was putting his head into a lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth by age 3.\u00c2\u00a0 This activity caused a lot of stress on Giovanni and Bruce and on March 26, 1979, their shared heart gave out.\u00c2\u00a0 Life was difficult for Hilda as a single mother until she met Bruno in 1982.\u00c2\u00a0 Bruno was one of the circus midgets who was new to the art of circus performing.\u00c2\u00a0 Bruno and Hilda had a good life together until 1989 when Bruno was accidently stepped on by Jumbo the elephant.\u00c2\u00a0 Hilda never fully recovered from that his loss.\u00c2\u00a0 She went into a deep depression that lasted throughout the remainder of her life.\u00c2\u00a0 She saw herself as cursed because of the fact that she had lost three lovers in the span of one decade.\u00c2\u00a0 On March 26, 1990, on the 11th anniversary of Giovanni and Bruce\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, she accidentally cut her jugular vein while trimming her beard.\u00c2\u00a0 Javier found her that evening after coming home from fire-eating practice.\u00c2\u00a0 It was at that point that Javier decided to give up circus life for good. ### A fresh start....\n\n<span>Beginning in December of 1995, Javier accepted a job with Computer City in San Antonio, TX.\u00c2\u00a0 working as a salesman in the upgrades department.\u00c2\u00a0 In March of 1996 Computer City decided to make their upgrade salesmen into technicians.\u00c2\u00a0 It was shortly after this that Javier proved himself to be a valuable leader and a knowledgeable technician.\u00c2\u00a0 He was made the Lead Upgrade Technician and was put in charge of the entire upgrades department.\u00c2\u00a0 Javier was happy in this position, but he longed for more.\u00c2\u00a0 Around July of 1996 a position became available with the Tandy Technical Service department in the back of the Computer City store.\u00c2\u00a0 Javier was offered the job and accepted it.\u00c2\u00a0 He was made the Apple\/Laptop technician.\u00c2\u00a0 It was Javier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s duty to service all Apple computers as well as all laptops that came into the service center.\u00c2\u00a0 This experience proved invaluable as Javier looked for his next opportunity.<\/span><span>In January of 1997, Javier accepted a position with NetForce, Inc.\u00c2\u00a0 He was stationed as a contract worker at Southwest Research Institute.\u00c2\u00a0 It was there that Javier spent the next three years of his career.\u00c2\u00a0 He began as a network administrator for the Non-destructive Evaluation division.\u00c2\u00a0 His duties included normal help-desk duties for a staff of 60 people who were running Macs, PCs and Sun computers.\u00c2\u00a0 Another duty which was bestowed upon him was the administration of the division\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aging Banyan Vines File Server.\u00c2\u00a0 About six months after starting at SwRI, Javier was put in charge of the Unix backup server as a result of his dedication and eagerness to learn.\u00c2\u00a0 It was around this time that Javier first began playing with something called Linux.\u00c2\u00a0 Within a span of six months he had taught himself enough about UNIX to take on the added responsibilities of the day to day administration of the division\u00e2\u0080\u0099s UNIX servers including tasks such as adding and deleting users, and DNS zone file modifications.\u00c2\u00a0 These were happy times for Javier.\u00c2\u00a0 He was in charge of 90% of the division network and was highly regarded by the people he worked so hard to support.<\/span>### <span>Troubling times....<\/span>\n\n<span>January of 1999 brought tragedy.\u00c2\u00a0 Due to the division\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inability to generate revenue during the previous five years, it was decided by the Institute's board of directors to dissolve the Non-destructive Evaluation division.\u00c2\u00a0 It was at this time that Javier was transferred to the Automation and Data Systems division at SwRI.\u00c2\u00a0 Javier was appointed the division\u00e2\u0080\u0099s UNIX administrator.\u00c2\u00a0 It was here that his experience in Sendmail, Solaris, Linux, BIND, NFS, Legato Networker and Solstice Disksuite came into play.\u00c2\u00a0 Javier was able to take a division whose UNIX resources were in shambles and make sense of the chaos.\u00c2\u00a0 Within a span of three months, Javier had single-handedly restored the division\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backup server to working order, migrated the division off of Banyan mail and onto a Sendmail\/POP3\/IMAP solution, and joined all of the Solaris workstations into a NIS environment.\u00c2\u00a0 Javier was happy once again, however the feeling would not last.\u00c2\u00a0 Tragedy, it seems, was never far from Javier.\u00c2\u00a0 SwRI had been showing interest for some time in wanting to hire Javier as a full-time employee, however NetForce was unwilling to part with one of their most valuable resources.\u00c2\u00a0 A war ensued between SwRI and NetForce resulting in a stalemate.\u00c2\u00a0 The actions of NetForce left Javier feeling embittered.\u00c2\u00a0 As a result, he felt that his time spent at SwRI had reached its end, and Javier began looking elsewhere\u00c2\u00a0for employment.\u00c2\u00a0 In February of 2000 Javier was offered a position with Rackspace.com (now Rackspace Hosting).\u00c2\u00a0 He accepted this position and in March of 2000 bid farewell to his friends and co-workers at SwRI.<\/span>### <span>Salvation....<\/span>\n\n<span>At Rackspace, Javier was assigned to Team D.\u00c2\u00a0 It was here that Javier was able to bring order to chaos.\u00c2\u00a0 He has been a beacon of light in a foggy, foggy world.\u00c2\u00a0 Javier has single-handedly taken Rey Mu\u00c3\u00b1iz and Rob Larson and molded them into fine young system administrators.\u00c2\u00a0 It is for these accomplishments that he will never be forgotten.<\/span><span>From a beginning as a circus performer, to his present career as a system administrator, Javier has persevered and challenged himself to new heights.\u00c2\u00a0 He has risen through the ashes of a broken childhood, like a phoenix he soars to new levels of greatness.<\/span>\n","html":"<h3>In the beginning....<\/h3>\r\nJavier Ayala was born to a couple of circus performers

Computer City store.\u00a0 Javier was offered the job and accepted it.\u00a0 He was made the Apple\/Laptop technician.\u00a0 It was Javier\u2019s duty to service all Apple computers as well as all laptops that came into the service center.\u00a0 This experience proved invaluable as Javier looked for his next opportunity.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span>In January of 1997, Javier accepted a position with NetForce, Inc.\u00a0 He was stationed as a contract worker at Southwest Research Institute.\u00a0 It was there that Javier spent the next three years of his career.\u00a0 He began as a network administrator for the Non-destructive Evaluation division.\u00a0 His duties included normal help-desk duties for a staff of 60 people who were running Macs, PCs and Sun computers.\u00a0 Another duty which was bestowed upon him was the administration of the division\u2019s aging Banyan Vines File Server.\u00a0 About six months after starting at SwRI, Javier was put in charge of the Unix backup server as a result of his dedication and eagerness to learn.\u00a0 It was around this time that Javier first began playing with something called Linux.\u00a0 Within a span of six months he had taught himself enough about UNIX to take on the added responsibilities of the day to day administration of the division\u2019s UNIX servers including tasks such as adding and deleting users, and DNS zone file modifications.\u00a0 These were happy times for Javier.\u00a0 He was in charge of 90% of the division network and was highly regarded by the people he worked so hard to support.<\/span>\r\n<h3><span>Troubling times....<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span>January of 1999 brought tragedy.\u00a0 Due to the division\u2019s inability to generate revenue during the previous five years, it was decided by the Institute's board of directors to dissolve the Non-destructive Evaluation division.\u00a0 It was at this time that Javier was transferred to the Automation and Data Systems division at SwRI.\u00a0 Javier was appointed the division\u2019s UNIX administrator.\u00a0 It was here that his experience in Sendmail, Solaris, Linux, BIND, NFS, Legato Networker and Solstice Disksuite came into play.\u00a0 Javier was able to take a division whose UNIX resources were in shambles and make sense of the chaos.\u00a0 Within a span of three months, Javier had single-handedly restored the division\u2019s backup server to working order, migrated the division off of Banyan mail and onto a Sendmail\/POP3\/IMAP solution, and joined all of the Solaris workstations into a NIS environment.\u00a0 Javier was happy once again, however the feeling would not last.\u00a0 Tragedy, it seems, was never far from Javier.\u00a0 SwRI had been showing interest for some time in wanting to hire Javier as a full-time employee, however NetForce was unwilling to part with one of their most valuable resources.\u00a0 A war ensued between SwRI and NetForce resulting in a stalemate.\u00a0 The actions of NetForce left Javier feeling embittered.\u00a0 As a result, he felt that his time spent at SwRI had reached its end, and Javier began looking elsewhere\u00a0for employment.\u00a0 In February of 2000 Javier was offered a position with Rackspace.com (now Rackspace Hosting).\u00a0 He accepted this position and in March of 2000 bid farewell to his friends and co-workers at SwRI.<\/span>\r\n<h3><span>Salvation....<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span>At Rackspace, Javier was assigned to Team D.\u00a0 It was here that Javier was able to bring order to chaos.\u00a0 He has been a beacon of light in a foggy, foggy world.\u00a0 Javier has single-handedly taken Rey Mu\u00f1iz and Rob Larson and molded them into fine young system administrators.\u00a0 It is for these accomplishments that he will never be forgotten.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span>From a beginning as a circus performer, to his present career as a system administrator, Javier has persevered and challenged himself to new heights.\u00a0 He has risen through the ashes of a broken childhood, like a phoenix he soars to new levels of greatness.<\/span>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Wed, 03 Dec 2008 15:48:24

Today, Laura and her mom depart for Zlin in the Czech Republic. She will be there for about 3 and half weeks while we attempt to get pregnant using IVF. Our decision to travel to the Czech Republic for IVF was based on two factors: 1) she was having problems releasing eggs making a natural conception difficult and 2) the price of IVF in Czech is less then half what it costs in the US. Travel included. I said good-bye to her this morning as I left for work. I won't see her until the 30th. I'm already incredibly sad about being apart from her. This is the longest we have been apart since getting married. We have grown ever so close since the horrible events of last February, and I truly feel as though she is physically a part of me now. I don't know how I'm going to make it through the next two weeks without her. I cried as we said our good-byes. The next two weeks will be full, so maybe that will help distract me from her absence. I will have Andi all to myself, and I have to get the house completely clean before I leave. When Laura comes back, she will need to be able to rest, and she can't have any undue stress in her life. This will be a high-risk pregnancy as it is, and stress will only increase the chances of mis-carriage. I need to do all that I can on my part to ensure the success of our IVF attempt. The next two weeks will not only be stressful for me, but also tiring. The time difference between here and Zlin is 7 hours. I will need to wake up at 5AM in order to have time to video-conference with Laura in Zlin, get ready for work, get Andi ready for school, and have her dropped off at Amy's house (our neighbor and Laura's new friend) by 6:30AM. Amy has been kind enough to agree to watch Andi before and after school. We probably won't be able to talk to Laura much after I get home from work because when it's 5PM here, it will be 12AM in Zlin. I really hope this works. If not I know we will both be devastated. The weeks leading up to today have been stressful enough. Laura's passport got lost when we sent it away for renewal, and when we tried to get her a new passport we realized that we couldn't find her birth certificate. This lead to a very stressful week as we awaited a new birth certificate in time for her to travel to Houston to obtain a replacement passport. Had she not gotten it in time, she wouldn't have been able to leave the country. We also had an issue getting the IVF meds she needed. The doctor in Zlin prescribed a medicine that was available overseas, but not here. Laura's OB\/GYN didn't know how to write a prescription for the same thing here. After a couple of VERY stressful days, I was able to locate the medicine here in San Antonio. As I type this, Laura and her mom are at the San Antonio Int'l Airport checking in. I hope to God that everything goes as planned. We have so much of our hopes and dreams riding on this. Please God, after what we went through last year, please toss us a bone. :-) J\n\n\n","html":"Well, the day is here.  Today, Laura and her mom depart for Zlin in the Czech Republic.

The second interview immediately followed the first.\u00c2\u00a0 The second interview was done by Dirk Elmendorf, one of Rackspace's founders.\u00c2\u00a0 He walked into the interview room barefoot and asked me a couple of Sun Solaris questions, which I answered.\u00c2\u00a0 It was when I saw him that I knew that this company was different.\u00c2\u00a0 This company was WAY more relaxed then any company I had ever worked with. The next day I received an offer letter from Rackspace.\u00c2\u00a0 After thinking about it for a couple of days, I accepted it and turned in my resignation to NetForce.\u00c2\u00a0 I was ecstatic!\u00c2\u00a0 Not only was I getting a new job at a company that seemed really cool to work for, but I was getting \"Dot Com\" benefits!\u00c2\u00a0 My new job at Rackspace was going to include stock options (this WAS the dot-com era after all), and not only FREE catered lunch every day but also all the free drinks and snacks I could ever want!\u00c2\u00a0 I couldn't wait to start! ### The First Day\n\n My first day at Rackspace (3\/2\/2000) was a Tuesday.\u00c2\u00a0 I remember this day well.\u00c2\u00a0 I arrived at the office (6th floor of The Weston Centre) around 8:30AM and sat in the Rackspace lobby for about an hour before someone showed up who actually knew who I was and could help me out starting my first day.\u00c2\u00a0 The first hour or so was spent filling out paperwork.\u00c2\u00a0 The next two hours were spent watching the infamous \"Dirk\" video.\u00c2\u00a0 I don't remember much about the video itself, except that a) I already knew all of the stuff that was discussed in the video, b) I couldn't wait for the video to end, and c) for quite a while it was required first day material for all Rackspace.com employees. Once the Dirk video was over, I was taken into the support area to meet my co-workers.\u00c2\u00a0 My next task was to build my workstation from scratch.\u00c2\u00a0 I was told to pull parts from the server build area, and put my machine together.\u00c2\u00a0 That part was easy.\u00c2\u00a0 The hard part was the fact that the network card that I grabbed was broken.\u00c2\u00a0 I spent a good part of the afternoon troubleshooting it, not wanting to admit defeat since it was my first day. Once my machine was up an running, I received training from my team lead.\u00c2\u00a0 My training consisted of him writing down the URL of the ticketing system on a Post-It, handing it to me and saying \"start closing tickets.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Just for reference, the current (as of 2010) onboarding process for new Rackspace employees consists of a week long orientation class called \"Rookie-O\" where they teach the new individuals about the company, as well as the basics of all of our internal tools and systems.\u00c2\u00a0 The new techs in my department also go through another month long training session within our department learning how to respond to tickets, etc.\u00c2\u00a0 I got a Post-It. ### 3\/3\/2000 and Beyond...\n\n A lot has happened in the 10 years that have passed since then.\u00c2\u00a0 Here is a list of some of the major events that have happened: - The \"dot-com\" bubble burst, delaying our IPO by 8 years.\n- Rackspace stopped serving us free lunches daily.\u00c2\u00a0 :-(\n- The company has grown from 67 employees on my first day to over 3,000 today.\n- What was once a small company which occupied one floor of the Weston Centre (office space and data center space combined) is now a multi-national company with data centers in Texas, Virginia, London and Hong Kong and offices in Texas, Virginia, London, and The Netherlands.\n- I have moved my desk countless times.\u00c2\u00a0 In all seriousness, I wouldn't be surprised if the number was greater then 50.\n- I have moved from the Weston Centre to the Broadway Bank building (which was across the street), back to the Weston Centre, over to the second floor of the Datapoint bulding, down to the first floor of the Datapoint building, then across town to the \"Mervyn's\" building of the Castle!\u00c2\u00a0 And that doesn't include all of the desk moves while I was in each of those locations!\n- I fulfilled my dream of traveling outside of North America by visiting Dublin, London (once for pleasure, once for work), and the Czech Republic.\n- Although I have been a support tech for my entire 10 years, the departments that I've been in have changed as the company has evolved.\u00c2\u00a0 These have included \"Complex\", \"Team F\", \"Red Label\", \"Intensive\" and \"Rackspace Enterprise Services\".\n- Although I was initially hired as Rackspace's only Sun Solaris tech (I was the only Sun tech for about 5 years), I have not touched a Solaris server in the last 2-3 years.\n- I have won the \"Fanatical Jacket\" award (Rackspace highest award for customer service) twice.\n- I divorced in 2001, and remarried in 2007.\n- I went from having one child when I started, to two children when I married, to four children in 2009.\n- I went through one of the hardest things I have ever been through when I buried my twin boys in June of 2009.\u00c2\u00a0 (They each only lived for a few hours after birth.)\u00c2\u00a0 I couldn't have gotten through this difficult time had it not been for the support of Rackspace and my co-workers.\n- After going my entire life firm in the belief that I could never see myself getting a tattoo, I ended up getting a tattoo to commemorate the twins.\n- I have made countless friends through work, and now know people spread across not only the country but the world.\n\n All in all, it's been a good ride.\u00c2\u00a0 This is the longest job I have ever held, and to put it in perspective, I have now worked for Rackspace nearly a third of my life.\u00c2\u00a0 Many of the 66 people who came before me have moved on (I think there are about 20 people who still work here that have been here longer then me), but still here I remain.\u00c2\u00a0 It's an odd feeling when I am sitting in a meeting room with everyone in my department and I think about the fact that not a single person in that room has been here as long as I have.\u00c2\u00a0 Kind of like when I went to the Rackspace UK office and realized that I pre-dated not only everyone in that office, but also the entire existence of Rackspace UK.\u00c2\u00a0 At times I wonder if it's time for a change.\u00c2\u00a0 But then I realize that if I made a change, it would only be for the sake making a change.\u00c2\u00a0 I love what I do, and I thank God every day that I get to do what I love and get paid for it.\u00c2\u00a0 That's when I realize that even after 10 years, I am happy right where I am.

only Sun Solaris tech (I was the only Sun tech for about 5 years), I have not touched a Solaris server in the last 2-3 years.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I have won the \"Fanatical Jacket\" award (Rackspace highest award for customer service) twice.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I divorced in 2001, and remarried in 2007.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I went from having one child when I started, to two children when I married, to four children in 2009.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I went through one of the hardest things I have ever been through when I buried my twin boys in June of 2009.\u00a0 (They each only lived for a few hours after birth.)\u00a0 I couldn't have gotten through this difficult time had it not been for the support of Rackspace and my co-workers.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>After going my entire life firm in the belief that I could never see myself getting a tattoo, I ended up getting a tattoo to commemorate the twins.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I have made countless friends through work, and now know people spread across not only the country but the world.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAll in all, it's been a good ride.\u00a0 This is the longest job I have ever held, and to put it in perspective, I have now worked for Rackspace nearly a third of my life.\u00a0 Many of the 66 people who came before me have moved on (I think there are about 20 people who still work here that have been here longer then me), but still here I remain.\u00a0 It's an odd feeling when I am sitting in a meeting room with everyone in my department and I think about the fact that not a single person in that room has been here as long as I have.\u00a0 Kind of like when I went to the Rackspace UK office and realized that I pre-dated not only everyone in that office, but also the entire existence of Rackspace UK.\u00a0 At times I wonder if it's time for a change.\u00a0 But then I realize that if I made a change, it would only be for the sake making a change.\u00a0 I love what I do, and I thank God every day that I get to do what I love and get paid for it.\u00a0 That's when I realize that even after 10 years, I am happy right where I am.\r\n\r\nJ","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 02 Mar 2010 07:00:22

What the Web App does is serve as a bank for her tickets so that we don't have to keep track of paper tickets. The app provides the ability to:\n\n- Bank tickets by Laura and I. Banking tickets requires a user account and passcode that is entered to authenticate that it is either Laura or I banking the tickets. It also records the GeoLocation at the time for future use.\n- Spend Ticket by Andi. There is an interface for Andi to select the number of tickets that she wants to spend with a slider, and then she puts in her passcode to authorize the spending. I am also recording the GeoLocation information of these transactions so that in the future if she does not remember a transaction, I will not only be able to show here when it was made, but also where. Since she is the only one with the ability to spend tickets, she can't claim that we spent them. :-)\n- Basic Reporting. Right now, the reporting is limited to an AJAX interface that shows you the transaction records in reverse chronological order. Each time you push the \"Show more\" button, it appends the next five entries to the display. Right now it only shows who made the transaction, the date\/time and whether it was a debit (shows as green) or a credit (shows as red). In the future I would like to add a way to also see on a map where the transaction took place.\n\n<div id=\"goodstuff\"><\/div>\n## *\"I Can Haz PW?\"* Web App & Extension\n\n The other app that I wrote is public and available for use. It started out as an iPhone web app for my \"[I Can Haz PW?](http:\/\/www.javierayala.com\/2011\/09\/i-can-haz-password\/ \"I Can Haz Password?\")\" website. It ended up being a Web App for just about any modern mobile device, such as an iPhone, iPad, Android, etc. It also works in a normal desktop browser. If you are using an iPhone or iPad with Safari, you can visit [http:\/\/icanhazpw.info\/](http:\/\/icanhazpw.info\/ \"I Can Haz PW?\") and it will detect your browser and forward you to [http:\/\/m.icanhazpw.info\/](http:\/\/m.icanhazpw.info\/ \"I Can Haz PW? Mobile Site\"). All other mobile browsers can try and going directly to [http:\/\/m.icanhazpw.info\/](http:\/\/m.icanhazpw.info\/ \"I Can Haz PW? Mobile Site\"). If you install it on your iOS device as a Home Screen Web App, it should also be available to you when you are not connected to a network or the Internet. I also took the code that I wrote, and bundled it into a [Google Chrome](http:\/\/www.google.com\/chrome \"Google Chrome\") extension. This allows you to quickly generate a random password from the Chrome web browser without having to leave the page that you are visiting. You can find the extension here: [http:\/\/icanhazpw.info\/chrome\/ICanHazPW_v1.crx](http:\/\/icanhazpw.info\/chrome\/ICanHazPW_v1.crx \"I Can Haz PW? - Google Chrome Extension\"). If anyone encounters any problems with either the WebApp or the Chrome Extension, send me an email at \"javier dot g dot ayala at me dot com\".
