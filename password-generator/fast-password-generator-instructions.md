As I first announced on [September 23, 2011](http://www.javierayala.com/2011/09/i-can-haz-password/), I have created a quick and easy way to generate random passwords. It is a website called [icanhazpw.info](http://icanhazpw.info) that does one thing and one thing only. Generates random passwords. When you go to that site, the only thing it returns as a response is the generated password, so it&#8217;s easy to use it in scripts or with curl, wget, etc.

_**Instructions for use**_

Using your favorite method (browser, curl, wget, etc.), go to one of the sites listed below:

[icanhazpw.info](http://icanhazpw.info/): Default site. Returns an 8 character password with a mixture of Alpha, Numbers and Special Characters

[an.icanhazpw.info](http://an.icanhazpw.info/) or [8an.icanhazpw.info](http://8an.icanhazpw.info/): Returns an 8 character password generated only from Alphanumeric characters. No Special Characters

[8.icanhazpw.info](http://8.icanhazpw.info/): An alias of the default site, returning an 8 character password consisting of Alpha, Numbers and Special Characters

[12.icanhazpw.info](http://12.icanhazpw.info/): Returns a 12 character password consisting of Alpha, Numbers and Special Characters

[16.icanhazpw.info](http://16.icanhazpw.info/): Returns a 16 character password consisting of Alpha, Numbers and Special Characters

More options could become available in the future, should the need arise.
